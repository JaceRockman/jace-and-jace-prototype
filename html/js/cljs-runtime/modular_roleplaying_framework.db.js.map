In its depths did sleep the nascent souls of our most holy Lords. First did emerge Ishiq, the Lady of Light, who glimpsed the once-dappled canopy, and thus her tears of solitude did fill the sky with its ceaseless flame. Then came Heilm, the Lord of Preservation, who's mighty hands grasped the great stones which had fallen to the depths and held them together as one. Then Ijarda, The Mother of All, came forth and whispered the passion of embers and ash into the dust of the land. Last, Kef, The Child of Whimsy and Mischief, escaped and stole the eye of Ishiq, the fist of Heilm, and the breath of Ijarda, bestowing them as gifts upon the lands and creatures of Kalashar. All was as all was meant to be until ages passed and the first cosmic dusk befell these lands and the Gods retreated into slumber once again. A stagnance blankets Kalashar and the land itself yearns for a second kindling.\"\n                 :territories [300 301]\n                 :tabs [20 21 22]}\n              ;; Adventures will take

They are well respected in Elven society since most Elves have at least a passing faith in Ishiq. They believe that the highest form of divination is conveying visual scenes and so they consider it blasphemy to attempt to record these visions with words. The only exception they make to this tenet is that they give some credence to The Tears of Ishiq, however, they still often lament that the Eldari lacked the modern methods of preserving and projecting visual memories. This distrust of written doctrine has left the Seers with a fairly vague theology which has in turn caused many conflicts and religious upheavals throughout the Elves\u2019 long history. The most violent of these occurred some 1,000 years ago and culminated in the banning of the Seers from the Elven Council. At the time, the Seers held much more direct power in Elven society as they were permitted to hold positions on the various Elven Councils. This eventually lead to corruption on the part of both the church and the body of councils. False visions were crafted in order to suggest that Ishiq was calling for a holy war against their human neighbors. The devout followers of Ishiq were baffled by this revelation and, however, there was no other option but for the Elves to begin mobilizing their armies. Many Humans and Elves died in the ensuing years and they are remembered by the Elves as the False War. It wasn't until a young prodigious Seer named Elheim uncovered the plot and the war was quickly abandoned though it left a great rift between Humans and Elves as well as eroded the trust in the Seers for centuries to come. It is said that centuries ago, Ishiq fell into a deep slumber alongside her deific counterparts and while there is still great observance of the faith, there are now those who doubt the authority of the Seers.\"\n                          :society \"Elven society is largely cohesive as there is extensive integration between all eleven of the Realms.

The closely guarded secrets of treesinging and woodsmithing produce a wide variety of weapons, armors, and tools that are much desired by the merchants of The Four Duchies, however, Elven law forbids the sale of woodsmithed products which has lead to a thriving black market of these items in the Eastern Realms.\"\n                          :politics \"The Vi\u00ebr Elen is the lord or lady ruler of the Elves, however, they do not have complete authority.

Each of these councils is presided over by a Speaker who upholds order during council meetings, votes in cases of national legislation and declarations of war, and serves as an adviser to the Vi\u00ebr Elen. National legislation can be brought to vote by any one of the Speakers or by the Vi\u00ebr Elen themself. If a piece of legislation has two Speakers who vote in favor, then it passes unless the Vi\u00ebr Elen vetoes it. If a piece of legislation has all three Speakers supporting it, then there is nothing that can prevent it from passing. Declarations of war may likewise be initiated by any one of the Speakers or the Vi\u00ebr Elen, however, in order for the declaration to pass it must have unanimous agreement. The Vi\u00ebr Elen may deem a Speaker unworthy of their post and that Speaker will be removed if their council agrees. The three Speakers and the Vi\u00ebr Elen reside in the Elven Capital City of Essevael in the Asturian Realm. Each of the eleven noble houses are given one seat on the Eiaven Council. Notably, the noble house of Asturias is granted the Speaker's seat which acts as the tie breaker when there is an even split amongst the other ten noble houses. Each of these noble houses rules over one of the Elven Realms creating laws as they see fit, just so long as those laws do not contradict any of the national legislation. The Speaker for the Fasfontan Council is also the Elven Warlord, or the Auth Arato, commanding the Elven armies in times of war and organizing the Elven guard in times of peace. Beneath the Auth Arato are the Commanders and then the Captains. Each Captain is given a single vote on the Fasfontan Council and each Commander is given five votes. The Auth Arato votes only when there is need for a tie breaker. The seats of the Messaram Council are available to any who have no noble titles and who are not actively enlisted in the military. Each one of the fifty-one seats corresponds to a major Elven City and the individual who holds the seat also serves as the Overseer for that city. The Overseer elections are held every five years and an Overseer may serve any number of terms. The Speaker of the Messaram Council is the Overseer of the Asturian Capital City, Essevael.

Those who wish to rise in the hierarchy and attain greater status as a Paladin may partake in the competitions where they are pitted against one another.

First they become an Initiate where they serve minor functions during court trials of the Paladins and learn the Dwarven fighting style. Then they become a Disciple studying under a higher ranked Paladin and acting as a scribe to them. Then they become a Sentinel where they join a patrol and serve under a Warden at the borders fending off Goblins and Orcs and their ilk. Then they become a Warden and they continue to serve as a leader of a patrol at the borders. Then they become a Witness where they work alongside and Arbiter assisting them in their endeavors.

Despite the fact that Dwarves do not often entertain Elven guests, they hold strong opinions about them. They distrust the Elves for the manipulations done by the Seers in generations past. Seers and Paladins once served side by side as leaders in the societies of Dwarves and Elves. A time came when the Seers on the Council of Elves foresaw war and conquest with mankind. In the bloody midst of war, the prophecies of this nature were discovered to be counterfeits by a young Master Elheim and the trust in the Seers was broken for many generations.

Their goods are transported via barge down the rivers that flow out of the Greyiron Mountains passing through Kleth and snaking all throughout The Four Duchies. A few other notable Dwarven exports are a wide array of meads and ales and various rare herbs and types of lumber from The Outwild Jungles.

Thus the Durfall clan has held the position for the last hundred years. Aside from public appearances, maintaining a presence at international negotiations, and organization of the Crucible of Heilm, the King's only real power is adjudicating disputes amongst Arbiters. The inauguration process takes place during the Crucible of Heilm and the heir of the Durfall clan challenges a specialized member of each rank of Paladin to compete.

This largely stems from the farming communities in Nidia who are her most fervent worshipers. This observance manifests mostly in the rituals of birth, marriage, and death and the celebrations of the vernal equinox, which is said to be the day of Ijarda's emergence from Kalashar. Among Humans, especially those in Erstead, a far greater observance is given to King Erdith who was the first ruler of man and the uniter of the disparate tribes millenia ago. Though it has been long, it is said that the spirit of Erdith has been reborn whenever mankind was in greatest need. This is why the rulers of Erstead are known as the Regents, for they only rule while Erdith rests. The stories say that the Erdithstone, which rests above the throne in the Kairinith palace, will shine once more when the soul of the king again takes breath. This is understood to mean that when the soul of Erdith has been reborn, the stone reacts to this rebirth and that it will illuminate to herald the coming of its lord. Those who worship King Erdith as more than just a man call themselves the Sons and Daughters of Erdith. This is the source of the tradition of the Kingsday celebration, where noble children are brought to stand in the throne room to test for the presence of King Erdith\u2019s soul.\"\n                          :society \"Erstead lies in the center of The Four Duchies and is the most densely populated of the four. As a result of its relative prosperity and the protection that it is granted by being surrounded by the three other duchies, the citizens of Erstead are perceived as being pompous and out of touch with the common folk. Erstead being home to the absurdly wealthy capital city of Kairinith only serves to reinforce this view. There is a widespread respect for the royal line and a significant number of those who follow The Sons of Erdith. While King Erdith rests, as has been the case for almost 200 years, the Aemon family rules in his stead not as Kings and Queens or Dukes and Duchesses, but rather as Regents. They have all of the power of the King, though tradition dictates that they wield this power only when the Kingdom is threatened. Kleth rests in the craggy foothills of The Greyiron Mountains. Klethians are a hardy independent folk consisting primarily of mercenaries, miners, and blacksmiths. They begrudge anything they perceive as an overreach of power and thus have a particularly unwelcoming attitude towards those of Erstead often referring to them as Steadlings. Many of those in Kleth feel a greater kinship with the Dwarves of The Greyiron Mountains than with the Humans of The Four Duchies. They often work alongside the Dwarves within the common mines and large passes of the mountains which are frequently assaulted by Goblins. This relationship results in a greater adherence to the teachings of Heilm than in any of the other duchies. The current ruler, Duchess Agata Kleth, is particularly fond of Heilm and she is well liked by her citizens. Umaeria is a bountiful land where the most clever scheming merchants come out on top. There are some who say that the Guildmeisters of Umaeria collectively hold more power than even Duke Claude Umaeria himself. As Umaeria is the largest of the duchies and has the greatest gap of wealth between merchants and workers, it has historically struggled with revolts and rebellions. These are often quelled with the assistance of the Erstead military forces and the mercenaries employed by the Merchant's Guild of Umaeria. In a similar vein, there have been many skirmishes between Umaeria and the Elves of the The Elderwoods as merchants tend to \\\"accidentally\\\" overextend their logging operations into Elven territory, however, such conflict has not manifested since an accord was produced between the Elven Council and the Guildmeisters. Nidia crowns The Four Duchies and although it is a bountiful land, there is little else to draw one to these marshy lands to the North. Most of the communities are but small agrarian villages known for their warm hospitality. Since oft times little else but rumors reach these communities, visits from outsiders are times not soon forgot there is a great deal of superstition and misinformation. Particularly, any technology or sciences unfamiliar to these rural lands are considered dark omens and should it be revealed that one dabbles in these occult practices, they may quickly find that they have overstayed their welcome.\"\n                          :economy \"There are three main trade circuits that distribute goods throughout The Four Duchies. The Laikendall route begins near the end of the Faelfest celebrations in Laikendall, which is in the Eastern territory if Nidia. They bring a full load of crops to Kairinith and their arrival heralds the Vernefest. During this celebration, these merchants acquire luxury items and travel South to Finipor by river and then back up through Kleth to arrive in Kairinith for the next Faelfest. The Veshtapor route begins in Kairinith, departing just after Vernefest. They take their goods and travel Southwest by river to arrive in Veshtapor in late Summer. Following the Finethire Way, they travel back East towards The Crossways and then North to return to Kairinith in time for Vernefest. The Finipor route likewise begins in Kairinith, departing just after Vernefest, however, they take their goods South along the Finethire Way towards The Crossways. They continue Eastwards towards Finipor and travel upriver to arrive in Kairinith by Vernefest. If merchants who take the Veshtapor or Finipor routes are delayed and do not return to Kairinith in time for the Vernefest, they will often take a lucrative detour through Trell before returning to their route in order to get back on schedule. The most skilled and dedicated merchants will take the difficult but rewarding trip all throughout The Four Duchies. They begin with the Laikendall route travelling towards Kairinith but then they go to Veshtapor and then to The Crossways taking a detour to Trell and then back up through The Crossways, Finipor, and Kleth to arrive back in Laikendall just in time for Faelfest. In total, this trip spans the course of three years, but with the right connections and a good bit of luck, you can make a veritable fortune off of a single pass of this grand route. The combination of these routes manages to distribute crops, precious stones, metals, and lumber to the entire Four Duchies as well as bringing enchanted and luxury items from Erstead to Umaeria.\"\n                          :politics \"While Dukes and Duchesses rule in Kleth, Umaeria, and Nidia, it is the Regents who rule in Erstead until the return of King Erdith. Duke Claude Umaeria is content to retain the status quo, however, the Guildmasters of Umaeria constantly seek to amend the accord with the Elves to expand their resources and influence. Duchess Agata Kleth is a fierce woman who feels more of a kinship with her Dwarven neighbors than with her fellow rulers. Over the many years of her rule, this disposition has grown only stronger as Kleth becomes more and more economically independent on the other duchies. While Regent Giles Aemon was once well loved by the citizens of Erstead, lately he has been seen as being responsible for the increases in taxes. It is now widely believed that he has lost touch with the people and many resent him for it.\"\n                          :military \"The Four Duchies was once a fairly militant society, but since the relationships with both the Dwarves and Elves have been relatively stable for the past few centuries, this aspect of their culture has abated.

The mercenaries and militias are some of the most competent bowmen in The Four Duchies. Kleth has a dedicated military force that is well trained and well equipped. This is necessitated by the invading forces of Goblins that frequently make it through the passes of The Greyiron Mountains. It is often that they work side by side with the Dwarves in driving these fell creatures back. Erstead's military presence is most often occupied with policing the streets of its many cities.

Checks to determine your character's level of knowledge will commonly be made as passive checks. The GM will still determine a target number and choose which stats are most relevant, and you will still put together your base dice pool. Instead of rolling, however, you will add the number of dice in your base dice pool to half the size of the dice and compare that to the target number as if it were the result of a normal check. One exception is that the result of a passive check cannot exceed the size of your ability die. So, if your base dice pool was 5d6, the result would be 6 instead of 8. Any bonuses or penalties that would be applied to the check simply add +1 or -1 to the result.\"\n                        :bonuses-and-penalties \"Checks may be made easier or more difficult by modifying your chances of success or modifying what you are capable of achieving.

When the limits of what you can accomplish are altered, you will add flat bonuses or penalties which are represented in the format of \\\"+1\\\" or \\\"-1\\\". When dice bonuses are added to a dice pool, you increase the number of dice in the pool by an amount equal to the number given in the bonus. The additional dice are of the same size as those in the base dice pool.\nWhen dice penalties are inflicted upon a dice pool, you decrease the number of dice in the pool by an amount equal to the number given in the penalty. If you are applying a dice penalty to a dice pool that only contains a single die, reduce the size of that die a number of times equal to the number given in the penalty. When flat bonuses or penalties are applied to a roll, you roll your base dice pool as you normally would and add or subtract the bonus or penalty before comparing it to the target number. If a dice bonus is applied after you roll your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the bonus dice and take the highest number between the dice pool and your bonus dice. If a dice penalty is inflicted after you roll all of your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the penalty dice one at a time and compare the result to the dice pool dice that you rolled. The die that is numerically closest to the penalty die you rolled is removed from the roll, rounding unfavorably, and then roll the next penalty dice.

When splintering your dice pool, each of the fragmentary dice pools must contain at least two dice.

Setup actions are small adjustments that don\u2019t take much focus, time, or effort. Engagement actions are where the bulk of the encounter takes place and they will usually require much more from you and have a risk of failure. Generally speaking, if an action requires a check, then it is likely an engagement action and if an action only requires a passive check or no check at all, then it is likely a setup action. Each combatant can take two setup actions during the setup phase and two engagement actions during the engagement phase. Combatants may take additional setup actions during the engagement phase as part of their engagement actions, however, each one of these setup actions inflicts a -1d penalty on both of their engagement actions. This penalty is applied even if you did not use either of your two setup actions in the setup phase. You may sacrifice one of your engagement actions to prevent these penalties from being applied to your other engagement action. You cannot take more than six setup actions in a round and you can\u2019t take more than two setup actions in a moment. Engagement actions are further divided into initiations and reactions. Initiations require you to have focus on a target while reactions can only be used when you are the target of another creature's initiation.

Within a moment, the dice pools with the fewest dice are resolved first. If two dice pools have the same number of dice, then the dice pool with the larger sized dice goes first. If that does not resolve the tie, then the GM simply decides which action is resolved first. In this way, modifications to your dice pool may cause your actions to be resolved earlier or later than they otherwise would be.

During the setup phase, creatures will have two setup actions that they can use to prepare themselves for the engagements that are to come. This phase will begin with everyone being given the opportunity to take the target action. Many engagement actions can only be used on targeted creatures or areas. Then everyone is given the opportunity to use their remaining setup actions. During the engagement phase, creatures will have two engagement actions which they can use to attempt to overcome the obstacles they have targeted.

Once the base dice pool has been modified, then the dice are rolled and the results are compared to a target number which represents the difficulty of the actions you are taking.

These bonuses and penalties can either alter your chances of success or alter what you are capable of achieving. When your chances of success are altered, you will add dice bonuses or penalties to your base dice pool which are represented in the format of \\\"+1d\\\" and \\\"-1d\\\". Dice bonuses and penalties cancel each other out and the final number is then applied to the base dice pool by adding or removing that number of dice. If a dice penalty would cause you to roll zero dice, instead, roll one die of the next size down. If a dice bonus is applied after you roll your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the bonus dice and compare the result of the dice pool in question to your bonus dice result and take the higher of the two. If a dice penalty is inflicted after you roll all of your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the penalty dice one at a time and compare the result to the dice pool dice that you rolled. The die that is numerically closest to the penalty die you rolled is removed from the roll, rounding unfavorably, and then repeat this process with any remaining penalty dice. If you have penalty dice remaining when there is only one die left in the dice pool in question, then roll the next penalty die and take the lower of the two results. Continue this process until there are no penalty dice left. For example, say you have rolled 2d8 and gotten a 7 and a 3 but before the check is resolved, you get a -2d penalty. You would then roll 1d8 for the first penalty die and let\u2019s say that it lands on a 5. You would remove the result closest to it, rounding unfavorably, so in this case, you would remove the 7 result and the new result of the roll is 3, however, you have 1 more penalty die remaining. You would then roll 1d8 for that second penalty die and let\u2019s say it lands on an 8. You would take the lower of the two results and so when your check is resolved, the result you give would be 3. On the other hand, when the limits of what you can accomplish are altered, you will add flat bonuses or penalties which are represented in the format of \\\"+1\\\" or \\\"-1\\\".

So if your base dice pool was 5d6, you could only splinter it into dice pools of 2d6 and 3d6, you could not splinter it into three die pools of 2d6, 2d6, and 1d6.

On the other hand, if you choose to act carefully, then each individual die is split into two dice of the next smallest size. So, that same roll of 4d6 would become 8d4 if the action was taken as carefully as possible. You can choose your degree of carefulness or recklessness by splitting or combining only some of the dice in the pool. Combining a dice pool of 4d6 into 2d8 is more reckless than combining that same dice pool of 4d6 into 1d8 + 2d6 and taking the highest result of those three dice. This modification can only be applied once, so you could not combine 4d4 into 2d6 and then combine those 2d6 into 1d8.

The GM will still determine a target number and choose which stats are most relevant, and you will still put together your base dice pool and add the bonuses and penalties. However, instead of modifying that dice pool and rolling those dice, you will add together the number of dice in the dice pool, the net value of the flat bonuses and penalties, and half of the size of the dice that are being rolled and use that as the result of your check. The result of a passive check cannot exceed the size of your ability die plus the net value of your flat bonuses and penalties. So, in a simple case, if your base dice pool was 2d6 and you had no bonuses or penalties, then the result would be determined by adding 2 for the number of dice to 3 for half the size of your dice for a total of 5. If the 2d6 had a flat bonus of +2, then that is added to the result as well as the cap on the check. So the result would be 7 with a maximum possible result of 8.

This phase will begin with everyone being given the opportunity to take the target action since many engagement actions can only be used on targeted creatures or areas. Then everyone is given the opportunity to use their remaining setup actions. During the engagement phase, creatures will have two engagement actions which they can use to attempt to overcome the obstacles they have targeted. This phase will usually involve traversing significant obstacles by climbing, swimming, jumping, etc., using items, attacking and defending, or various forms of persuasion. The round ends once all of the engagement actions have been resolved or when a moment passes where no dice were rolled for engagement actions.\"\n                         :moments \"After the setup phase of a round is complete and bonuses and penalties have been added to everyone\u2019s base dice pools, the first moment of the engagement phase begins. When a moment begins, anyone who would like to act in that moment may commit dice to the moment by setting them aside. You can choose to commit only a portion of your dice pool to the moment by splintering them from their current dice pool and you can also commit multiple fragmentary dice pools to a single moment. Once everyone has committed their dice, they may modify them by combining or splitting them and then everyone rolls their dice at the same time. The dice that have been rolled are resolved in the following manner: the dice pools with the fewest dice are resolved first, if two dice pools have the same number of dice, then the dice pool with the larger sized dice goes first. If that does not resolve the tie, then the GM simply decides which action is resolved first. This means that modifications to your dice pool may cause your actions to be resolved earlier or later than they otherwise would be. Reckless actions will have fewer dice and so will be resolved earlier while careful actions will have more dice and so be resolved later. Once all of the rolls committed to a moment have been resolved, the next moment of the round begins and everyone who has dice remaining in their dice pool may choose to commit dice to the next moment following the same rules as in the prior moment.\"\n                         :actions \"There are two types of actions: setup actions and engagement actions. Setup actions are small adjustments that don\u2019t take much focus, time, or effort. Engagement actions are where the bulk of the encounter takes place and they will usually require much more from you and have a risk of failure. Generally speaking, if an action requires a check, then it is likely an engagement action and if an action only requires a passive check or no check at all, then it is likely a setup action. Each combatant can take two setup actions during the setup phase and two engagement actions during the engagement phase. Combatants may take additional setup actions during the engagement phase as part of their engagement actions, however, each one of these setup actions inflicts a -1d penalty on both of their engagement actions. This penalty is applied even if you did not use either of your two setup actions in the setup phase. You may sacrifice one of your engagement actions to prevent these penalties from being applied to your other engagement action. You cannot take more than six setup actions in a round and you can\u2019t take more than two setup actions in a moment. Engagement actions are further divided into initiations and reactions. Initiations require you to have focus on a target while reactions can only be used when you are the target of another creature's initiation. Listed below are some examples of the two kinds of actions.\"}}\n           12031 {:id 12031\n                  :title \"Recovery\"\n                  :type \"text\"\n                  :text {:overview \"Both in and out of encounters, your character will have to react to events around them in an attempt to prevent harm to themself. Often times, when these reactions fail, your character will take damage. This damage is tracked separately for each of the four domains: physical, spiritual, mental, and social.

If the attack roll is equal to or greater than the reaction roll + 3, then you take a major injury. When you are inflicted with an injury, record the severity of the injury and the domain in which it was inflicted. It may also help to keep a running total of the points of damage you have in each domain. Minor injuries inflict one point of damage while major injuries inflict two points of damage.\"\n                         :conditions \"There are three conditions that can apply to each domain that are inflicted on your character as they take increasing numbers of injuries: Wounded, Incapacitated, and Dead. You will make health checks to determine when these conditions are applied and the health check for each domain is that domain's continuation skill. If you receive an injury in a domain and the new total number of injuries exceeds half of the passive result of your health check rounded favorably, then you become inflicted with the Wounded condition in that domain. If you are inflicted with the Wounded condition and you take further damage in that domain, you must make a health check for that domain where the target number is equal to the new damage total. If your health check fails, then you become inflicted with the Incapacitated condition in that domain. If at any point, the total damage in a domain exceeds your maximum possible roll, then you are inflicted with the final condition in that domain - Dead. Whenever your wounds heal, look at your most severe condition in that domain. If you rolled to receive that condition, then roll a health check now where the target number is equal to your new damage total. If you succeed, then remove the condition. If the condition was received as a result of passing a threshold, then compare your new damage total to the threshold. If it is equal to or lesser than the damage threshold, then remove the condition. If inflicted with the Death condition in the Physical, Spiritual, or Mental domain, your character is no longer playable unless there is some process or item that specifically reverses the condition. The Death condition in the Social domain is relative to the circumstances in which it was acquired and so your character is still playable, however, the individuals that you are \u201cdead to\u201d so to speak may never want to interact with you again or they may become hostile to you.\"\n                         :recovery \"Minor injuries will heal naturally after 2 days while major injuries will heal naturally after 1 week.
