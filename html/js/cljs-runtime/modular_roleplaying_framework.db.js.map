In its depths did sleep the nascent souls of our most holy Lords. First did emerge Ishiq, the Lady of Light, who glimpsed the once-dappled canopy, and thus her tears of solitude did fill the sky with its ceaseless flame. Then came Heilm, the Lord of Preservation, who's mighty hands grasped the great stones which had fallen to the depths and held them together as one. Then Ijarda, The Mother of All, came forth and whispered the passion of embers and ash into the dust of the land. Last, Kef, The Child of Whimsy and Mischief, escaped and stole the eye of Ishiq, the fist of Heilm, and the breath of Ijarda, bestowing them as gifts upon the lands and creatures of Kalashar. All was as all was meant to be until ages passed and the first cosmic dusk befell these lands and the Gods retreated into slumber once again. A stagnance blankets Kalashar and the land itself yearns for a second kindling.\"\r\n                 :territories [300 301]\r\n                 :tabs [20 21 22]}\r\n              ;; Adventures will

They are well respected in Elven society since most Elves have at least a passing faith in Ishiq. They believe that the highest form of divination is conveying visual scenes and so they consider it blasphemy to attempt to record these visions with words. The only exception they make to this tenet is that they give some credence to The Tears of Ishiq, however, they still often lament that the Eldari lacked the modern methods of preserving and projecting visual memories. This distrust of written doctrine has left the Seers with a fairly vague theology which has in turn caused many conflicts and religious upheavals throughout the Elves\u2019 long history. The most violent of these occurred some 1,000 years ago and culminated in the banning of the Seers from the Elven Council. At the time, the Seers held much more direct power in Elven society as they were permitted to hold positions on the various Elven Councils. This eventually lead to corruption on the part of both the church and the body of councils. False visions were crafted in order to suggest that Ishiq was calling for a holy war against their human neighbors. The devout followers of Ishiq were baffled by this revelation and, however, there was no other option but for the Elves to begin mobilizing their armies. Many Humans and Elves died in the ensuing years and they are remembered by the Elves as the False War. It wasn't until a young prodigious Seer named Elheim uncovered the plot and the war was quickly abandoned though it left a great rift between Humans and Elves as well as eroded the trust in the Seers for centuries to come. It is said that centuries ago, Ishiq fell into a deep slumber alongside her deific counterparts and while there is still great observance of the faith, there are now those who doubt the authority of the Seers.\"\r\n                          :society \"Elven society is largely cohesive as there is extensive integration between all eleven of the Realms.

Elves are most unwelcoming to Dwarves ever since the False War. Due to their great rarity, Elves are often intrigued more than disgusted when they encounter Orcs or Goblins.\"\r\n                          :economy \"The Economy of the Elves is largely self-sustained with occasional luxury items imported from The Four Duchies. Elves have developed complex methods of agriculture and woodsmithing providing all of the food and resources required for their civilization to run smoothly. The closely guarded secrets of treesinging and woodsmithing produce a wide variety of weapons, armors, and tools that are much desired by the merchants of The Four Duchies, however, Elven law forbids the sale of woodsmithed products which has lead to a thriving black market of these items in the Eastern Realms.\"\r\n                          :politics \"The Vi\u00ebr Elen is the lord or lady ruler of the Elves, however, they do not have complete authority. They answer to the three Elven Councils: Eiaven, the Council of Nobles, Fasfontan, the Council of War, and Messaram, the Council of the People. Each of these councils is presided over by a Speaker who upholds order during council meetings, votes in cases of national legislation and declarations of war, and serves as an adviser to the Vi\u00ebr Elen. National legislation can be brought to vote by any one of the Speakers or by the Vi\u00ebr Elen themself. If a piece of legislation has two Speakers who vote in favor, then it passes unless the Vi\u00ebr Elen vetoes it. If a piece of legislation has all three Speakers supporting it, then there is nothing that can prevent it from passing. Declarations of war may likewise be initiated by any one of the Speakers or the Vi\u00ebr Elen, however, in order for the declaration to pass it must have unanimous agreement. The Vi\u00ebr Elen may deem a Speaker unworthy of their post and that Speaker will be removed if their council agrees. The three Speakers and the Vi\u00ebr Elen reside in the Elven Capital City of Essevael in the Asturian Realm. Each of the eleven noble houses are given one seat on the Eiaven Council. Notably, the noble house of Asturias is granted the Speaker's seat which acts as the tie breaker when there is an even split amongst the other ten noble houses. Each of these noble houses rules over one of the Elven Realms creating laws as they see fit, just so long as those laws do not contradict any of the national legislation. The Speaker for the Fasfontan Council is also the Elven Warlord, or the Auth Arato, commanding the Elven armies in times of war and organizing the Elven guard in times of peace. Beneath the Auth Arato are the Commanders and then the Captains. Each Captain is given a single vote on the Fasfontan Council and each Commander is given five votes. The Auth Arato votes only when there is need for a tie breaker. The seats of the Messaram Council are available to any who have no noble titles and who are not actively enlisted in the military. Each one of the fifty-one seats corresponds to a major Elven City and the individual who holds the seat also serves as the Overseer for that city. The Overseer elections are held every five years and an Overseer may serve any number of terms. The Speaker of the Messaram Council is the Overseer of the Asturian Capital City, Essevael.

There is a straightforward hierarchy of leadership amongst the Order of Heilm which is determined by the Crucible of Heilm. The Crucible of Heilm is a series of tournaments and competitions held every four years. Those who wish to join the ranks of the Paladins must complete the Trial of the Gauntlet, a grueling and dangerous series of tasks and challenges. Those who wish to rise in the hierarchy and attain greater status as a Paladin may partake in the competitions where they are pitted against one another. Should they manage to defeat two contenders of their own rank and one of a higher rank, they will be evaluated for their deeds throughout the past four years. Should their might and vigilance be deemed worthy, they will attain the next rank. While there are many ways to serve as a Paladin of Heilm, the most common path is as follows. First they become an Initiate where they serve minor functions during court trials of the Paladins and learn the Dwarven fighting style. Then they become a Disciple studying under a higher ranked Paladin and acting as a scribe to them. Then they become a Sentinel where they join a patrol and serve under a Warden at the borders fending off Goblins and Orcs and their ilk. Then they become a Warden and they continue to serve as a leader of a patrol at the borders. Then they become a Witness where they work alongside and Arbiter assisting them in their endeavors. Finally, they become an Arbiter themself, free to enforce the will of Heilm as they see fit.

Despite the fact that Dwarves do not often entertain Elven guests, they hold strong opinions about them. They distrust the Elves for the manipulations done by the Seers in generations past. Seers and Paladins once served side by side as leaders in the societies of Dwarves and Elves. A time came when the Seers on the Council of Elves foresaw war and conquest with mankind. In the bloody midst of war, the prophecies of this nature were discovered to be counterfeits by a young Master Elheim and the trust in the Seers was broken for many generations.

Their goods are transported via barge down the rivers that flow out of the Greyiron Mountains passing through Kleth and snaking all throughout The Four Duchies. A few other notable Dwarven exports are a wide array of meads and ales and various rare herbs and types of lumber from The Outwild Jungles.

Thus the Durfall clan has held the position for the last hundred years. Aside from public appearances, maintaining a presence at international negotiations, and organization of the Crucible of Heilm, the King's only real power is adjudicating disputes amongst Arbiters.

This largely stems from the farming communities in Nidia who are her most fervent worshipers. This observance manifests mostly in the rituals of birth, marriage, and death and the celebrations of the vernal equinox, which is said to be the day of Ijarda's emergence from Kalashar. Among Humans, especially those in Erstead, a far greater observance is given to King Erdith who was the first ruler of man and the uniter of the disparate tribes millenia ago. Though it has been long, it is said that the spirit of Erdith has been reborn whenever mankind was in greatest need. This is why the rulers of Erstead are known as the Regents, for they only rule while Erdith rests. The stories say that the Erdithstone, which rests above the throne in the Kairinith palace, will shine once more when the soul of the king again takes breath. This is understood to mean that when the soul of Erdith has been reborn, the stone reacts to this rebirth and that it will illuminate to herald the coming of its lord. Those who worship King Erdith as more than just a man call themselves the Sons and Daughters of Erdith. This is the source of the tradition of the Kingsday celebration, where noble children are brought to stand in the throne room to test for the presence of King Erdith\u2019s soul.\"\r\n                          :society \"Erstead lies in the center of The Four Duchies and is the most densely populated of the four. As a result of its relative prosperity and the protection that it is granted by being surrounded by the three other duchies, the citizens of Erstead are perceived as being pompous and out of touch with the common folk. Erstead being home to the absurdly wealthy capital city of Kairinith only serves to reinforce this view. There is a widespread respect for the royal line and a significant number of those who follow The Sons of Erdith. While King Erdith rests, as has been the case for almost 200 years, the Aemon family rules in his stead not as Kings and Queens or Dukes and Duchesses, but rather as Regents. They have all of the power of the King, though tradition dictates that they wield this power only when the Kingdom is threatened. Kleth rests in the craggy foothills of The Greyiron Mountains. Klethians are a hardy independent folk consisting primarily of mercenaries, miners, and blacksmiths. They begrudge anything they perceive as an overreach of power and thus have a particularly unwelcoming attitude towards those of Erstead often referring to them as Steadlings. Many of those in Kleth feel a greater kinship with the Dwarves of The Greyiron Mountains than with the Humans of The Four Duchies. They often work alongside the Dwarves within the common mines and large passes of the mountains which are frequently assaulted by Goblins. This relationship results in a greater adherence to the teachings of Heilm than in any of the other duchies. The current ruler, Duchess Agata Kleth, is particularly fond of Heilm and she is well liked by her citizens. Umaeria is a bountiful land where the most clever scheming merchants come out on top. There are some who say that the Guildmeisters of Umaeria collectively hold more power than even Duke Claude Umaeria himself. As Umaeria is the largest of the duchies and has the greatest gap of wealth between merchants and workers, it has historically struggled with revolts and rebellions. These are often quelled with the assistance of the Erstead military forces and the mercenaries employed by the Merchant's Guild of Umaeria. In a similar vein, there have been many skirmishes between Umaeria and the Elves of the The Elderwoods as merchants tend to \\\"accidentally\\\" overextend their logging operations into Elven territory, however, such conflict has not manifested since an accord was produced between the Elven Council and the Guildmeisters. Nidia crowns The Four Duchies and although it is a bountiful land, there is little else to draw one to these marshy lands to the North. Most of the communities are but small agrarian villages known for their warm hospitality. Since oft times little else but rumors reach these communities, visits from outsiders are times not soon forgot there is a great deal of superstition and misinformation. Particularly, any technology or sciences unfamiliar to these rural lands are considered dark omens and should it be revealed that one dabbles in these occult practices, they may quickly find that they have overstayed their welcome.\"\r\n                          :economy \"There are three main trade circuits that distribute goods throughout The Four Duchies. The Laikendall route begins near the end of the Faelfest celebrations in Laikendall, which is in the Eastern territory if Nidia. They bring a full load of crops to Kairinith and their arrival heralds the Vernefest. During this celebration, these merchants acquire luxury items and travel South to Finipor by river and then back up through Kleth to arrive in Kairinith for the next Faelfest. The Veshtapor route begins in Kairinith, departing just after Vernefest. They take their goods and travel Southwest by river to arrive in Veshtapor in late Summer. Following the Finethire Way, they travel back East towards The Crossways and then North to return to Kairinith in time for Vernefest. The Finipor route likewise begins in Kairinith, departing just after Vernefest, however, they take their goods South along the Finethire Way towards The Crossways. They continue Eastwards towards Finipor and travel upriver to arrive in Kairinith by Vernefest. If merchants who take the Veshtapor or Finipor routes are delayed and do not return to Kairinith in time for the Vernefest, they will often take a lucrative detour through Trell before returning to their route in order to get back on schedule. The most skilled and dedicated merchants will take the difficult but rewarding trip all throughout The Four Duchies. They begin with the Laikendall route travelling towards Kairinith but then they go to Veshtapor and then to The Crossways taking a detour to Trell and then back up through The Crossways, Finipor, and Kleth to arrive back in Laikendall just in time for Faelfest. In total, this trip spans the course of three years, but with the right connections and a good bit of luck, you can make a veritable fortune off of a single pass of this grand route. The combination of these routes manages to distribute crops, precious stones, metals, and lumber to the entire Four Duchies as well as bringing enchanted and luxury items from Erstead to Umaeria.\"\r\n                          :politics \"While Dukes and Duchesses rule in Kleth, Umaeria, and Nidia, it is the Regents who rule in Erstead until the return of King Erdith. Duke Claude Umaeria is content to retain the status quo, however, the Guildmasters of Umaeria constantly seek to amend the accord with the Elves to expand their resources and influence. Duchess Agata Kleth is a fierce woman who feels more of a kinship with her Dwarven neighbors than with her fellow rulers. Over the many years of her rule, this disposition has grown only stronger as Kleth becomes more and more economically independent on the other duchies. While Regent Giles Aemon was once well loved by the citizens of Erstead, lately he has been seen as being responsible for the increases in taxes. It is now widely believed that he has lost touch with the people and many resent him for it.\"\r\n                          :military \"The Four Duchies was once a fairly militant society, but since the relationships with both the Dwarves and Elves have been relatively stable for the past few centuries, this aspect of their culture has abated. Umaeria possesses very little in the way of an official militia, though it has significant forces to call upon in ways of mercenaries and private militias employed by merchants and guilds. The mercenaries and militias are some of the most competent bowmen in The Four Duchies. Kleth has a dedicated military force that is well trained and well equipped.

Checks to determine your character's level of knowledge will commonly be made as passive checks. The GM will still determine a target number and choose which stats are most relevant, and you will still put together your base dice pool. Instead of rolling, however, you will add the number of dice in your base dice pool to half the size of the dice and compare that to the target number as if it were the result of a normal check. One exception is that the result of a passive check cannot exceed the size of your ability die. So, if your base dice pool was 5d6, the result would be 6 instead of 8. Any bonuses or penalties that would be applied to the check simply add +1 or -1 to the result.\"\r\n                        :bonuses-and-penalties \"Checks may be made easier or more difficult by modifying your chances of success or modifying what you are capable of achieving.

When the limits of what you can accomplish are altered, you will add flat bonuses or penalties which are represented in the format of \\\"+1\\\" or \\\"-1\\\". When dice bonuses are added to a dice pool, you increase the number of dice in the pool by an amount equal to the number given in the bonus. The additional dice are of the same size as those in the base dice pool.\r\nWhen dice penalties are inflicted upon a dice pool, you decrease the number of dice in the pool by an amount equal to the number given in the penalty. If you are applying a dice penalty to a dice pool that only contains a single die, reduce the size of that die a number of times equal to the number given in the penalty. When flat bonuses or penalties are applied to a roll, you roll your base dice pool as you normally would and add or subtract the bonus or penalty before comparing it to the target number. If a dice bonus is applied after you roll your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the bonus dice and take the highest number between the dice pool and your bonus dice. If a dice penalty is inflicted after you roll all of your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the penalty dice one at a time and compare the result to the dice pool dice that you rolled. The die that is numerically closest to the penalty die you rolled is removed from the roll, rounding unfavorably, and then roll the next penalty dice.

If you choose to splinter your base dice pool, the total number of dice that you roll remains unchanged. When splintering your dice pool, each of the fragmentary dice pools must contain at least two dice. So if your base dice pool was 5d6, you could only splinter it into die pools of 2d6 and 3d6, you could not splinter it into three die pools of 2d6, 2d6, and 1d6.

On the other hand, if you choose to act carefully, then each individual die is split into two dice of the next smallest size. So, that same roll of 4d6 would become 8d4 if the action was taken as carefully as possible. You can choose your degree of carefulness or recklessness by splitting or combining only some of the dice in the pool. Combining a dice pool of 4d6 into 2d8 is more reckless than combining that same dice pool of 4d6 into 1d8 + 2d6 and taking the highest result of those three dice. This modification can only be applied once, so you could not combine 4d4 into 2d6 and then combine those 2d6 into 1d8.

Other examples of scenes that may be counted as encounters are chase scenes, detailed social functions, navigation through treacherous territories, heists, and investigations. Encounters are the most structured and game-like portions of an adventure. Your GM may decide to run some encounters just like they would any other part of the adventure, however, if they want to track the order of actions a bit more carefully, then they may use the following structure.\"\r\n                        :actions \"There are two types of actions: setup actions and engagement actions. Setup actions are small adjustments that don\u2019t take much focus, time, or effort. Engagement actions are where the bulk of the encounter takes place and they will usually require much more from you and have a risk of failure. Generally speaking, if an action requires a check, then it is likely an engagement action and if an action only requires a passive check or no check at all, then it is likely a setup action. Each combatant can take two setup actions during the setup phase and two engagement actions during the engagement phase. Combatants may take additional setup actions during the engagement phase as part of their engagement actions, however, each one of these setup actions inflicts a -1d penalty on both of their engagement actions. This penalty is applied even if you did not use either of your two setup actions in the setup phase. You may sacrifice one of your engagement actions to prevent these penalties from being applied to your other engagement action. You cannot take more than six setup actions in a round and you can\u2019t take more than two setup actions in a moment. Engagement actions are further divided into initiations and reactions. Initiations require you to have focus on a target while reactions can only be used when you are the target of another creature's initiation. Listed below are some examples of the two kinds of actions.\"\r\n                        :moments \"After the setup phase of a round is complete, the first moment of the engagement phase begins. Anyone who would like to act in that moment may choose modifications to their dice pool such as splintering, acting carefully, or acting recklessly. As usual, bonuses and penalties are applied first, then splintering that base dice pool must be done before dice are combined or split for acting carefully or recklessly. If you choose to splinter your base dice pool, you can decide whether to act multiple times in the current moment or spread out your action between moments. Within a moment, the dice pools with the fewest dice are resolved first. If two dice pools have the same number of dice, then the dice pool with the larger sized dice goes first. If that does not resolve the tie, then the GM simply decides which action is resolved first. In this way, modifications to your dice pool may cause your actions to be resolved earlier or later than they otherwise would be. Once all of those rolls have been resolved, the next moment of the round begins and everyone who has dice remaining in their dice pool may choose to roll following the same rules as in the prior moment.\"\r\n                        :rounds \"The in-game duration of a round depends very much on the encounter you are involved in. In the case of combat, a round will usually take about five to ten seconds whereas in a social encounter, a round may take twenty minutes or an hour or even longer. Rounds are made up of two phases: the setup phase and the engagement phase. During the setup phase, creatures will have two setup actions that they can use to prepare themselves for the engagements that are to come. This phase will begin with everyone being given the opportunity to take the target action. Many engagement actions can only be used on targeted creatures or areas. Then everyone is given the opportunity to use their remaining setup actions. During the engagement phase, creatures will have two engagement actions which they can use to attempt to overcome the obstacles they have targeted. This phase will usually involve traversing significant obstacles by climbing, swimming, jumping, etc., using items that you have on hand, attacking and defending, or various forms of persuasion.

If you have penalty dice remaining when there is only one die left in the dice pool in question, then roll the next penalty die and take the lower of the two results. Continue this process until there are no penalty dice left. For example, say you have rolled 2d8 and gotten a 7 and a 3 but before the check is resolved, you get a -2d penalty. You would then roll 1d8 for the first penalty die and let\u2019s say that it lands on a 5. You would remove the result closest to it, rounding unfavorably, so in this case, you would remove the 7 result and the new result of the roll is 3, however, you have 1 more penalty die remaining. You would then roll 1d8 for that second penalty die and let\u2019s say it lands on an 8. You would take the lower of the two results and so when your check is resolved, the result you give would be 3. On the other hand, when the limits of what you can accomplish are altered, you will add flat bonuses or penalties which are represented in the format of \\\"+1\\\" or \\\"-1\\\". When flat bonuses or penalties are applied to a roll, they cancel each other out and the final number is added to or subtracted from the roll result before comparing it to the target number.\"\r\n                         :splintering \"After bonuses and penalties are applied but before the roll is made, you may choose to splinter your base dice pool into multiple fragmentary pools. This represents taking multiple actions with a single check. A common example of this is when you attack multiple enemies at once. If you choose to splinter your base dice pool, the total number of dice that you roll remains unchanged and each of the fragmentary dice pools must contain at least two dice. So if your base dice pool was 5d6, you could only splinter it into dice pools of 2d6 and 3d6, you could not splinter it into three die pools of 2d6, 2d6, and 1d6. Flat bonuses and penalties must be distributed as evenly as possible amongst the fragmentary dice pools.\"\r\n                         :combining-and-splitting \"The final modification that can be made to a dice pool before rolling is combining dice into larger sizes or splitting them into smaller sizes. This represents your choice of acting recklessly or carefully. If you choose to act recklessly, then two dice may be combined into a single die of the next highest size. So, if you were rolling 4d6 and you chose to act recklessly, you could instead roll 2d8. On the other hand, if you choose to act carefully, then each individual die is split into two dice of the next smallest size. So, that same roll of 4d6 would become 8d4 if the action was taken as carefully as possible. You can choose your degree of carefulness or recklessness by splitting or combining only some of the dice in the pool. Combining a dice pool of 4d6 into 2d8 is more reckless than combining that same dice pool of 4d6 into 1d8 + 2d6 and taking the highest result of those three dice. This modification can only be applied once, so you could not combine 4d4 into 2d6 and then combine those 2d6 into 1d8. Similarly, you could not split 2d8 into 4d6 and then split those 4d6 into 8d4.\"\r\n                         :passive \"Passive checks may be used by the GM to resolve situations where your character\u2019s stats are relevant but where there are no actions that your character takes to resolve the situation. Checks to determine your character's level of knowledge on a topic or checks to notice something in your surroundings when you aren\u2019t searching will commonly be made as passive checks. The GM will still determine a target number and choose which stats are most relevant, and you will still put together your base dice pool and add the bonuses and penalties. However, instead of modifying that dice pool and rolling those dice, you will add together the number of dice in the dice pool, the net value of the flat bonuses and penalties, and half of the size of the dice that are being rolled and use that as the result of your check. The result of a passive check cannot exceed the size of your ability die plus the net value of your flat bonuses and penalties. So, in a simple case, if your base dice pool was 2d6 and you had no bonuses or penalties, then the result would be determined by adding 2 for the number of dice to 3 for half the size of your dice for a total of 5. If the 2d6 had a flat bonus of +2, then that is added to the result as well as the cap on the check. So the result would be 7 with a maximum possible result of 8. Once the result is determined, it is compared to the target number determined by the GM as usual. Passive checks cannot be modified by splintering, combining, or splitting.\"}}\r\n           12021 {:id 12021\r\n                  :title \"Encounters\"\r\n                  :type \"text\"\r\n                  :text {:overview \"An encounter is a scene that is centered around a goal and obstacle where many of your actions require skill checks. One of the clearest examples of an encounter is combat. During combat, the most basic goal is survival, the obstacle to that goal is the creatures or characters that are trying to kill you, and most of your actions will relate to attacking, defending, or positioning which all frequently require skill checks. Other examples of scenes that may be counted as encounters are chase scenes, social functions, survivalist challenges, heists, and investigations. Encounters are the most structured portions of an adventure. Your GM may decide to run some encounters more casually just like they would any other part of the adventure, however, if they want to track the order of actions more carefully, then they may use the following structure.\"\r\n                         :rounds \"The in-game duration of a round depends on the encounter you are involved in. In the case of small scale combat, a round will usually take about five to ten seconds whereas in something like a social encounter, a round may take twenty minutes or an hour or even longer. Rounds are made up of two phases: the setup phase and the engagement phase. During the setup phase, creatures will have two setup actions that they can use to prepare themselves for the engagements that are to come. This phase will begin with everyone being given the opportunity to take the target action since many engagement actions can only be used on targeted creatures or areas. Then everyone is given the opportunity to use their remaining setup actions. During the engagement phase, creatures will have two engagement actions which they can use to attempt to overcome the obstacles they have targeted. This phase will usually involve traversing significant obstacles by climbing, swimming, jumping, etc., using items, attacking and defending, or various forms of persuasion. The round ends once all of the engagement actions have been resolved or when a moment passes where no dice were rolled for engagement actions.\"\r\n                         :moments \"After the setup phase of a round is complete and bonuses and penalties have been added to everyone\u2019s base dice pools, the first moment of the engagement phase begins. When a moment begins, anyone who would like to act in that moment may commit dice to the moment by setting them aside. You can choose to commit only a portion of your dice pool to the moment by splintering them from their current dice pool and you can also commit multiple fragmentary dice pools to a single moment. Once everyone has committed their dice, they may modify them by combining or splitting them and then everyone rolls their dice at the same time. The dice that have been rolled are resolved in the following manner: the dice pools with the fewest dice are resolved first, if two dice pools have the same number of dice, then the dice pool with the larger sized dice goes first. If that does not resolve the tie, then the GM simply decides which action is resolved first. This means that modifications to your dice pool may cause your actions to be resolved earlier or later than they otherwise would be. Reckless actions will have fewer dice and so will be resolved earlier while careful actions will have more dice and so be resolved later. Once all of the rolls committed to a moment have been resolved, the next moment of the round begins and everyone who has dice remaining in their dice pool may choose to commit dice to the next moment following the same rules as in the prior moment.\"\r\n                         :actions \"There are two types of actions: setup actions and engagement actions. Setup actions are small adjustments that don\u2019t take much focus, time, or effort. Engagement actions are where the bulk of the encounter takes place and they will usually require much more from you and have a risk of failure. Generally speaking, if an action requires a check, then it is likely an engagement action and if an action only requires a passive check or no check at all, then it is likely a setup action. Each combatant can take two setup actions during the setup phase and two engagement actions during the engagement phase. Combatants may take additional setup actions during the engagement phase as part of their engagement actions, however, each one of these setup actions inflicts a -1d penalty on both of their engagement actions. This penalty is applied even if you did not use either of your two setup actions in the setup phase. You may sacrifice one of your engagement actions to prevent these penalties from being applied to your other engagement action. You cannot take more than six setup actions in a round and you can\u2019t take more than two setup actions in a moment. Engagement actions are further divided into initiations and reactions. Initiations require you to have focus on a target while reactions can only be used when you are the target of another creature's initiation. Listed below are some examples of the two kinds of actions.\"}}\r\n           12031 {:id 12031\r\n                  :title \"Recovery\"\r\n                  :type \"text\"\r\n                  :text {:overview \"Both in and out of encounters, your character will have to react to events around them in an attempt to prevent harm to themself.

If you receive an injury in a domain and the new total number of injuries exceeds half of the passive result of your health check rounded favorably, then you become inflicted with the Wounded condition in that domain. If you are inflicted with the Wounded condition and you take further damage in that domain, you must make a health check for that domain where the target number is equal to the new damage total. If your health check fails, then you become inflicted with the Incapacitated condition in that domain. If at any point, the total damage in a domain exceeds your maximum possible roll, then you are inflicted with the final condition in that domain - Dead.
