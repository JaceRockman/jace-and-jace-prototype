around a goal and obstacle where many of your actions require skill checks. One of the clearest examples of an encounter is combat. During combat, the most basic goal is survival, the obstacle to that goal is the creatures or characters that are trying to kill you, and most of your actions will relate to attacking, defending, or position which all frequently require skill checks. Other examples of scenes that may be counted as encounters are chase scenes, social functions, survival, heists, and investigations. Encounters are the most structured portions of an adventure. Your GM may decide to run some encounters more casually just like they would any other part of the adventure, however, if they want to track the order of actions more carefully, then they may use the following structure.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"rounds","rounds",1157201084),"The in-game duration of a round depends on the encounter you are involved in. In the case of small scale combat, a round will usually take about five to ten seconds whereas in something like a social encounter, a round may take twenty minutes or an hour or even longer. Rounds are made up of two phases: the setup phase and the engagement phase. During the setup phase, creatures will have two setup actions that they can use to prepare themselves for the engagements that are to come. This phase will begin with everyone being given the opportunity to take the target action since many engagement actions can only be used on targeted creatures or areas. Then everyone is given the opportunity to use their remaining setup actions. During the engagement phase, creatures will have two engagement actions which they can use to attempt to overcome the obstacles they have targeted. This phase will usually involve traversing significant obstacles by climbing, swimming, jumping, etc., using items, attacking and defending, or various forms of persuasion. The round ends once all of the engagement actions have been resolved or when a moment passes where no dice were rolled for engagement actions.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"moments","moments",-1541189836),"After the setup phase of a round is complete and bonuses and penalties have been added to everyone\u2019s base dice pools, the first moment of the engagement phase begins. When a moment begins, anyone who would like to act in that moment may commit dice to the moment by setting them aside. You can choose to commit only a portion of your dice pool to the moment by splintering them from their current dice pool and you can also commit multiple fragmentary dice pools to a single moment. Once everyone has committed their dice, they may modify them by combining or splitting them and then everyone rolls their dice at the same time. The dice that have been rolled are resolved in the following manner: the dice pools with the fewest dice are resolved first, if two dice pools have the same number of dice, then the dice pool with the larger sized dice goes first. If that does not resolve the tie, then the GM simply decides which action is resolved first. This means that modifications to your dice pool may cause your actions to be resolved earlier or later than they otherwise would be. Reckless actions will have fewer dice and so will be resolved earlier while careful actions will have more dice and so be resolved later. Once all of the rolls committed to a moment have been resolved, the next moment of the round begins and everyone who has dice remaining in their dice pool may choose to commit dice to the next moment following the same rules as in the prior moment.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"actions","actions",-812656882),"There are two types of actions: setup actions and engagement actions. Setup actions are small adjustments that don\u2019t take much focus, time, or effort. Engagement actions are where the bulk of the encounter takes place and they will usually require much more from you and have a risk of failure. Generally speaking, if an action requires a check, then it is likely an engagement action and if an action only requires a passive check or no check at all, then it is likely a setup action. Each combatant can take two setup actions during the setup phase and two engagement actions during the engagement phase. Combatants may take additional setup actions during the engagement phase as part of their engagement actions, however, each one of these setup actions inflicts a -1d penalty on both of their engagement actions. This penalty is applied even if you did not use either of your two setup actions in the setup phase. You may sacrifice one of your engagement actions to prevent these penalties from being applied to your other engagement action. You cannot take more than six setup actions in a round and you can\u2019t take more than two setup actions in a moment. Engagement actions are further divided into initiations and reactions. Initiations require you to have focus on a target while reactions can only be used when you are the target of another creature's initiation.

This observance manifests mostly in the rituals of birth, marriage, and death and the celebrations of the vernal equinox, which is said to be the day of Ijarda's emergence from Kalashar. Among Humans, especially those in Erstead, a far greater observance is given to King Erdith who was the first ruler of man and the uniter of the disparate tribes millenia ago. Though it has been long, it is said that the spirit of Erdith has been reborn whenever mankind was in greatest need. This is why the rulers of Erstead are known as the Regents, for they only rule while Erdith rests. The stories say that the Erdithstone, which rests above the throne in the Kairinith palace, will shine once more when the soul of the king again takes breath. This is understood to mean that when the soul of Erdith has been reborn, the stone reacts to this rebirth and that it will illuminate to herald the coming of its lord. Those who worship King Erdith as more than just a man call themselves the Sons and Daughters of Erdith.

As a result of its relative prosperity and the protection that it is granted by being surrounded by the three other duchies, the citizens of Erstead are perceived as being pompous and out of touch with the common folk. Erstead being home to the absurdly wealthy capital city of Kairinith only serves to reinforce this view. There is a widespread respect for the royal line and a significant number of those who follow The Sons of Erdith. While King Erdith rests, as has been the case for almost 200 years, the Aemon family rules in his stead not as Kings and Queens or Dukes and Duchesses, but rather as Regents. They have all of the power of the King, though tradition dictates that they wield this power only when the Kingdom is threatened. Kleth rests in the craggy foothills of The Greyiron Mountains. Klethians are a hardy independent folk consisting primarily of mercenaries, miners, and blacksmiths. They begrudge anything they perceive as an overreach of power and thus have a particularly unwelcoming attitude towards those of Erstead often referring to them as Steadlings. Many of those in Kleth feel a greater kinship with the Dwarves of The Greyiron Mountains than with the Humans of The Four Duchies. They often work alongside the Dwarves within the common mines and large passes of the mountains which are frequently assaulted by Goblins. This relationship results in a greater adherence to the teachings of Heilm than in any of the other duchies. The current ruler, Duchess Agata Kleth, is particularly fond of Heilm and she is well liked by her citizens. Umaeria is a bountiful land where the most clever scheming merchants come out on top. There are some who say that the Guildmeisters of Umaeria collectively hold more power than even Duke Claude Umaeria himself. As Umaeria is the largest of the duchies and has the greatest gap of wealth between merchants and workers, it has historically struggled with revolts and rebellions. These are often quelled with the assistance of the Erstead military forces and the mercenaries employed by the Merchant's Guild of Umaeria. In a similar vein, there have been many skirmishes between Umaeria and the Elves of the The Elderwoods as merchants tend to \"accidentally\" overextend their logging operations into Elven territory, however, such conflict has not manifested since an accord was produced between the Elven Council and the Guildmeisters. Nidia crowns The Four Duchies and although it is a bountiful land, there is little else to draw one to these marshy lands to the North. Most of the communities are but small agrarian villages known for their warm hospitality. Since oft times little else but rumors reach these communities, visits from outsiders are times not soon forgot there is a great deal of superstition and misinformation. Particularly, any technology or sciences unfamiliar to these rural lands are considered dark omens and should it be revealed that one dabbles in these occult practices, they may quickly find that they have overstayed their welcome.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"economy","economy",502906683),"There are three main trade circuits that distribute goods throughout The Four Duchies. The Laikendall route begins near the end of the Faelfest celebrations in Laikendall, which is in the Eastern territory if Nidia. They bring a full load of crops to Kairinith and their arrival heralds the Vernefest. During this celebration, these merchants acquire luxury items and travel South to Finipor by river and then back up through Kleth to arrive in Kairinith for the next Faelfest. The Veshtapor route begins in Kairinith, departing just after Vernefest. They take their goods and travel Southwest by river to arrive in Veshtapor in late Summer. Following the Finethire Way, they travel back East towards The Crossways and then North to return to Kairinith in time for Vernefest. The Finipor route likewise begins in Kairinith, departing just after Vernefest, however, they take their goods South along the Finethire Way towards The Crossways. They continue Eastwards towards Finipor and travel upriver to arrive in Kairinith by Vernefest. If merchants who take the Veshtapor or Finipor routes are delayed and do not return to Kairinith in time for the Vernefest, they will often take a lucrative detour through Trell before returning to their route in order to get back on schedule. The most skilled and dedicated merchants will take the difficult but rewarding trip all throughout The Four Duchies. They begin with the Laikendall route travelling towards Kairinith but then they go to Veshtapor and then to The Crossways taking a detour to Trell and then back up through The Crossways, Finipor, and Kleth to arrive back in Laikendall just in time for Faelfest. In total, this trip spans the course of three years, but with the right connections and a good bit of luck, you can make a veritable fortune off of a single pass of this grand route. The combination of these routes manages to distribute crops, precious stones, metals, and lumber to the entire Four Duchies as well as bringing enchanted and luxury items from Erstead to Umaeria.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"politics","politics",-448638170),"While Dukes and Duchesses rule in Kleth, Umaeria, and Nidia, it is the Regents who rule in Erstead until the return of King Erdith. Duke Claude Umaeria is content to retain the status quo, however, the Guildmasters of Umaeria constantly seek to amend the accord with the Elves to expand their resources and influence. Duchess Agata Kleth is a fierce woman who feels more of a kinship with her Dwarven neighbors than with her fellow rulers. Over the many years of her rule, this disposition has grown only stronger as Kleth becomes more and more economically independent on the other duchies. While Regent Giles Aemon was once well loved by the citizens of Erstead, lately he has been seen as being responsible for the increases in taxes.

Umaeria possesses very little in the way of an official militia, though it has significant forces to call upon in ways of mercenaries and private militias employed by merchants and guilds. The mercenaries and militias are some of the most competent bowmen in The Four Duchies. Kleth has a dedicated military force that is well trained and well equipped. This is necessitated by the invading forces of Goblins that frequently make it through the passes of The Greyiron Mountains. It is often that they work side by side with the Dwarves in driving these fell creatures back. Erstead's military presence is most often occupied with policing the streets of its many cities.

Then they become a Disciple studying under a higher ranked Paladin and acting as a scribe to them.

One exception is that the result of a passive check cannot exceed the size of your ability die. So, if your base dice pool was 5d6, the result would be 6 instead of 8.

When the limits of what you can accomplish are altered, you will add flat bonuses or penalties which are represented in the format of \"+1\" or \"-1\".

If a dice bonus is applied after you roll your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the bonus dice and take the highest number between the dice pool and your bonus dice. If a dice penalty is inflicted after you roll all of your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the penalty dice one at a time and compare the result to the dice pool dice that you rolled. The die that is numerically closest to the penalty die you rolled is removed from the roll, rounding unfavorably, and then roll the next penalty dice.

If you choose to splinter your base dice pool, the total number of dice that you roll remains unchanged. When splintering your dice pool, each of the fragmentary dice pools must contain at least two dice. So if your base dice pool was 5d6, you could only splinter it into die pools of 2d6 and 3d6, you could not splinter it into three die pools of 2d6, 2d6, and 1d6.

On the other hand, if you choose to act carefully, then each individual die is split into two dice of the next smallest size. So, that same roll of 4d6 would become 8d4 if the action was taken as carefully as possible. You can choose your degree of carefulness or recklessness by splitting or combining only some of the dice in the pool. Combining a dice pool of 4d6 into 2d8 is more reckless than combining that same dice pool of 4d6 into 1d8 + 2d6 and taking the highest result of those three dice. This modification can only be applied once, so you could not combine 4d4 into 2d6 and then combine those 2d6 into 1d8.

at a cost. If it is impossible for a skill check to fail or to succeed, then there is nothing to check. If a skill check has a reasonable chance of both success and failure but there is no cost for the actions either way, then the character could just continue to try again until they succeed. Ultimately, it is up to the GM\u2019s discretion when a skill check should be called for. When a skill check is called for, you will use your character\u2019s stats to determine the check\u2019s base dice pool. The base dice pool may then be modified in three ways which must occur in the following order: bonuses and penalties, splintering the dice pool, and combining or splitting dice. Once the base dice pool has been modified, then the dice are rolled and the results are compared to a target number which represents the difficulty of the actions you are taking. For example, say the dice pool you roll for a skill check is 3d6 and you roll a 1, 3, and 4. The result of the check would be the 4 and the other two numbers are ignored.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"base-dice-pool","base-dice-pool",-2000848897),"When a check is called for, the GM will determine which of your stats is most relevant to the task at hand and the dice pool provided under that stat will become your base dice pool. For example, if you are trying to climb a cliffside, the GM may ask for a check using your coordination skill. If your coordination skill is 2d8, then your base dice pool would be two 8-sided dice.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"bonuses-and-penalties","bonuses-and-penalties",606200007),"Circumstances and resources can affect skill checks by granting bonuses to make them easier or inflicting penalties to make them more difficult. These bonuses and penalties can either alter your chances of success or alter what you are capable of achieving. When your chances of success are altered, you will add dice bonuses or penalties to your base dice pool which are represented in the format of \"+1d\" and \"-1d\". Dice bonuses and penalties cancel each other out and the final number is then applied to the base dice pool by adding or removing that number of dice. If a dice penalty would cause you to roll zero dice, instead, reduce the size of the dice to the next size down. If a dice bonus is applied after you roll your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the bonus dice and compare the result of the dice pool in question to your bonus dice result and take the higher of the two. If a dice penalty is inflicted after you roll all of your dice but before the roll is resolved, then roll the penalty dice one at a time and compare the result to the dice pool dice that you rolled. The die that is numerically closest to the penalty die you rolled is removed from the roll, rounding unfavorably, and then repeat this process with any remaining penalty dice. If you have penalty dice remaining when there is only one die left in the dice pool in question, then roll the next penalty die and take the lower of the two results. Continue this process until there are no penalty dice left. For example, say you have rolled 2d8 and gotten a 7 and a 3 but before the check is resolved, you get a -2d penalty. You would then roll 1d8 for the first penalty die and let\u2019s say that it lands on a 5. You would remove the result closest to it, rounding unfavorably, so in this case, you would remove the 7 result and the new result of the roll is 3, however, you have 1 more penalty die remaining. You would then roll 1d8 for that second penalty die and let\u2019s say it lands on an 8. You would take the lower of the two results and so when your check is resolved, the result you give would be 3. On the other hand, when the limits of what you can accomplish are altered, you will add flat bonuses or penalties which are represented in the format of \"+1\" or \"-1\". When flat bonuses or penalties are applied to a roll, they cancel each other out and the final number is added to or subtracted from the roll result before comparing it to the target number.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"splintering","splintering",-1707231919),"After bonuses and penalties are applied but before the roll is made, you may choose to splinter your base dice pool into multiple fragmentary pools. This represents taking multiple actions with a single check. A common example of this is when you attack multiple enemies at once. If you choose to splinter your base dice pool, the total number of dice that you roll remains unchanged and each of the fragmentary dice pools must contain at least two dice. So if your base dice pool was 5d6, you could only splinter it into dice pools of 2d6 and 3d6, you could not splinter it into three die pools of 2d6, 2d6, and 1d6. Flat bonuses and penalties must be distributed as evenly as possible amongst the fragmentary dice pools.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"combining-and-splitting","combining-and-splitting",-1963502873),"The final modification that can be made to a dice pool before rolling is combining dice into larger sizes or splitting them into smaller sizes. This represents your choice of acting recklessly or carefully. If you choose to act recklessly, then two dice may be combined into a single die of the next highest size. So, if you were rolling 4d6 and you chose to act recklessly, you could instead roll 2d8. On the other hand, if you choose to act carefully, then each individual die is split into two dice of the next smallest size. So, that same roll of 4d6 would become 8d4 if the action was taken as carefully as possible. You can choose your degree of carefulness or recklessness by splitting or combining only some of the dice in the pool. Combining a dice pool of 4d6 into 2d8 is more reckless than combining that same dice pool of 4d6 into 1d8 + 2d6 and taking the highest result of those three dice. This modification can only be applied once, so you could not combine 4d4 into 2d6 and then combine those 2d6 into 1d8. Similarly, you could not split 2d8 into 4d6 and then split those 4d6 into 8d4.",new cljs.core.Keyword(null,"passive","passive",252884080),"Passive checks may be used by the GM to resolve situations where your character\u2019s stats are relevant but where there are no actions that your character takes to resolve the situation. Checks to determine your character's level of knowledge on a topic or checks to notice something in your surroundings when you aren\u2019t searching will commonly be made as passive checks. The GM will still determine a target number and choose which stats are most relevant, and you will still put together your base dice pool and add the bonuses and penalties. However, instead of modifying that dice pool and rolling those dice, you will add together the number of dice in the dice pool, the net value of the bonuses and penalties, and half of the size of the dice that are being rolled and use that as the result of your check. One exception is that the result of a passive check cannot exceed the size of your ability die combined with the net value of your flat bonuses and penalties. So, in a simple case, if your base dice pool was 2d6 and you had no bonuses or penalties, then the result would be determined by adding 2 for the number of dice to 3 for half the size of your dice for a total of 5. If the 2d6 had a flat bonus of +2, then that is added to the result as well as the cap on the check. So the result would be 7 with a maximum possible result of 8.

Generally speaking, if an action requires a check, then it is likely an engagement action and if an action only requires a passive check or no check at all, then it is likely a setup action. Each combatant can take two setup actions during the setup phase and two engagement actions during the engagement phase. Combatants may take additional setup actions during the engagement phase as part of their engagement actions, however, each one of these setup actions inflicts a -1d penalty on both of their engagement actions. This penalty is applied even if you did not use either of your two setup actions in the setup phase. You may sacrifice one of your engagement actions to prevent these penalties from being applied to your other engagement action. You cannot take more than six setup actions in a round and you can\u2019t take more than two setup actions in a moment. Engagement actions are further divided into initiations and reactions.

The only exception they make to this tenet is that they give some credence to The Tears of Ishiq, however, they still often lament that the Eldari lacked the modern methods of preserving and projecting visual memories. This distrust of written doctrine has left the Seers with a fairly vague theology which has in turn caused many conflicts and religious upheavals throughout the Elves\u2019 long history. The most violent of these occurred some 1,000 years ago and culminated in the banning of the Seers from the Elven Council. At the time, the Seers held much more direct power in Elven society as they were permitted to hold positions on the various Elven Councils. This eventually lead to corruption on the part of both the church and the body of councils. False visions were crafted in order to suggest that Ishiq was calling for a holy war against their human neighbors. The devout followers of Ishiq were baffled by this revelation and, however, there was no other option but for the Elves to begin mobilizing their armies. Many Humans and Elves died in the ensuing years and they are remembered by the Elves as the False War. It wasn't until a young prodigious Seer named Elheim uncovered the plot and the war was quickly abandoned though it left a great rift between Humans and Elves as well as eroded the trust in the Seers for centuries to come.
